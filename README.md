# TheDocs

TheDocs is a powerful, responsive, and high-performance html online documentation template which can help you rapidly develop your next software's documentation. It can be used for documenting API, frameworks, plugins, templates, etc. It's based on Bootstrap and contains a lot of components to easily make your interactive documentation.

TheDocs comes with a simple design and puts its focus on readability and functionality. It has a lot of useful components to reduce the burden of writing a documentation for your next product. With the help of TheDocs just focus on the quality of writing; don't worry about the quality of design and ease of writing. We guarantee them!

## What's included

Within the download package you'll find the following directories:

```
thedocs/
├── starter/
├── theme/
└── v1.4/
```

- `starter`: It includes starter templates to get started with. This is the place you should choose a starter, copy a directory and start your project with. There's a complete documentation inside a readme.html file for each starter template.
- `theme`: This directory contains all the files that you see in the online demo. You should use these files to copy codes or files from and develop your own project. Also, it's a documentation and reference for our components.
- `v1.4`: The previous major release of TheDocs.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, TheDocs is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See CHANGELOG.md for list of changes in each release.


## Upgrade from TheDocs v1.x to v2.x

This is the second major release of TheDocs which is based on the stable release of Bootstrap 4. The previous version (v1.x) is based on the Bootstrap 3. As the version number implies, this release contains a lot of breaking changes due to breaking changes from Bootstrap 4. So there's not any guide on how to upgrade from TheDocs v1.x to TheDocs v2.x. Since the v1.x is already stable enough, you don't have to upgrade your project at all—unless you have enough time to recreate it using the current release of TheDocs. But if you're starting new project, TheDocs v2.x is the best choice.
